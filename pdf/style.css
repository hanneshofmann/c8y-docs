   Swapping the colors for h4 and h5. The standard c8y-docs stylesheet checks is the output
   page width is less that 992px, in which case the h4 font size is set to the same as the
   h5 font size. This makes it hard to distinguish between them in PDF output. 
   So the following settings use a stronger color for h4.

   "Info" and "Important" boxes are implemented in Hugo HTML as "blockquote" elements.
    The background shading should be possible with "blockquote {background-color: #f2f8fd; }", 
    but this doesn't seem to work. Also not by adding "!important".
    So using border shading instead. Instead of surounding the whole text in a box frame,
    I am just displaying a thick colored left border. 
    The color #f2f8fd doesn't show up well in the generated PDFs, so using a color that is 
    easier to see.

/* ChrisB 2020-02-27
   The text size in "Info" and "Important" boxes was larger than the surrounding text in the PDFs.
   This appears to be because the standard setting of "blockquote" elements is 16px, as defined
   in c8y-docs\themes\c8ydocs\assets\scss\_typography.scss.
   Therefore I have switched the text size explicitly to the smaller size of 14px.
   I tried setting it on the blockquote element itself, but that didn't work, so I am using the 
   CSS selector "blockquote>p" to select the "<p>" element inside the "<blockquote>".
