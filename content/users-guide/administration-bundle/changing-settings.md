### Changing authentication settings

Click **Authentication** in the **Settings** menu if you want to view or change the Login or TFA settings.

![Password settings](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-settings-authentication.png)

>**Info:** If the menu is not visible, confirm the user has one of the following roles: `ROLE_TENANT_ADMIN` or `ROLE_TENANT_MANAGEMENT_ADMIN`.


#### Login settings

In the **Preferred login mode** field, you can select one of the following options:

* OAuth Internal - Recommended, since it provides high security, using authorization tokens to prove your identity (to the server).
* Basic Auth - Should be chosen only for specific compatibility reasons, since it only provides basic security.
* Single sign-on redirect - Can be selected only if SSO is configured. If selected, will remove Basic Auth and OAuth Internal login options.


This login mode will be used by the platform's applications as the default method to authenticate users. Device authentication stays unchanged.

>**Info:** If OAuth Internal is enforced, Basic Auth cannot be used to login to applications anymore. Older applications might fail to display the login correctly and need to be updated.

In the field **Limit password validity for**, you can limit the validity of user passwords by specifying the number of days after which users have to change their passwords. If you do not want to force your users to change passwords, use "0" for unlimited validity of passwords (default value).

>**Info:** The password validity limit and the enforcing of strong passwords may not be editable, if configured by the platform administrator.
>
>**Info:** The password validity limit is not imposed on users with a "devices" role. This prevents devices passwords from expiring.

By default, users can use any password with eight characters or more. If you select **Enforce that all password are "strong" (green)**, your users must provide strong passwords as described in [Getting Started > Accessing and logging into the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform](/users-guide/getting-started/#login).

Strong (green) passwords must have "M" characters. By default, the system restricts the use of passwords already used in the past. The last "N" passwords provided by a user are remembered by the system and the system does not allow to use them. The default value for "N" is 10.

>**Info:** "M" and "N" can be configured by the platform administrator.

Click **Save** to apply the settings.

>**Important:** Each time you change the login mode you will be forced to log out. Other users will need to log out and log in again so that the change is applied.

#### TFA settings

Select the checkbox **Allow two-factor authentication** if you want to allow TFA in your tenant (only possible for administrators).

You may choose one of the following options:

* **SMS-based**, supporting the following settings:
	- **Limit token validity for**: Lifetime of each session in minutes. When the session expires or a user logs out, the user has to enter a new verification code.
   - **Limit verification code validity for**: Here you can set the lifetime of each verification code sent via SMS. When the verification code expires, in order to login the user has to request a new verification code.

	> **Info:** An SMS gateway microservice must be configured for the tenant. Naturally only users with a valid phone number associated can use this functionality.

* **Google Authenticator** (Time-based One-Time Password = TOTP), supporting the following setting:
	 - **Enforce TOTP two-factor authentication on all users**: When enabled it will force all users to set up their TFA on login. Otherwise each individual user can choose to activate it or not.

	> **Info:** The TOTP method is only available with the login mode "OAuth Internal".

Click **Save TFA settings** to apply your settings.

>**Important:** Each time you change the TFA method you will be forced to log out. Users TFA settings are cleared and need to be configured again.

>**Info:** Users with a "devices" role are excluded from TFA and TOTP. This is also true when TOTP is enforced for all users.

<a name="oauth-internal"></a>
### Oauth Internal

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} OAuth Internal is based on JWT stored in a browser cookie. However, it doesn't support refresh and after the token validity time has ended, the user will have to log in again.
The lifespan for both, token and cookie, is configurable by tenant options belonging to the category `oauth.internal`.

#### Token settings
The default token validity time is two weeks and this can be changed with tenant options:
 - category: `oauth.internal`;
 - key: `basic-token.lifespan.seconds`;

The minimum allowed value is 5 minutes.

#### Cookies settings
Cookies used to store a token in a browser have their own validity time that can be changed with tenant options:
- category: `oauth.internal`;
- key: `basic-user.cookie.lifespan.seconds`;

The default value is two weeks. It can also be set to any negative value so that the cookie will be deleted when the user closes the browser.

Refer to the [Tenant API](https://{{< domain-c8y >}}/api/{{< c8y-current-version >}}/#tag/Tenant-API) in the {{< openapi >}} for more details.

> **Info:** If external communication to the {{< management-tenant >}} has been blocked than it is only possible to access the tenant in a secure way (for example via SSH tunnel).
This means that you can just as well use basic authentication. Additionally, it is not possible
to use OAuth authentication since the communication from the external authorization server is also blocked.
Therefore, the authentication method is automatically set to "Basic authentication" if the {{< management-tenant >}} is configured to block external communication.


<a name="single-sign-on"></a>
### Configuring single sign-on

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} provides single sign-on functionality, that allows a user to login with a single 3rd-party authorization server using the OAuth2 protocol, for example Azure Active Directory. Currently authorization code grant is supported only with access tokens in form of JWT.

> **Info:** This feature is built on top of cookies technology. To be able to use it, you must have cookies enabled in the settings of your browser.

This feature is enabled since {{< product-c8y-iot >}} version 10.4.6. For correct behavior any microservice needs to use the microservice SDK with version 10.4.6 or later.

Before switching to the single sign-on option it is mandatory that:

* The authorization server you use supports OAuth2 authorization code grant.
* The access token is issued as JWT and you know what goes into the token content.
* The JWT must consist of a unique user identifier, "iss" (issuer), "aud" (audience) and "exp" (expiration time) fields.
* The {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform is in version 10.4.6 but preferably higher.
* All microservices are build with Microservice Java SDK 10.4.6 but preferably higher. For custom-built microservices, refer to [General aspects > Security](/microservice-sdk/concept/#security) in the *Microservice SDK guide*.
* For on premises installation the domain-based tenant resolution is configured properly.

>**Info:** In order to use the single sign-on feature for {{< enterprise-tenant >}}s, the enterprise domain must be set up as redirect URI in the basic configurations. If single sign-on providers have a list of allowed domains, the enterprise domain should be added to that list.


#### Configuration settings

To enable the feature, the administrator has to configure a connection with the authorization server. This is done in the Administration application.

Click **Single sign-on** in the **Settings** menu in the navigator.

At the top left, you can choose a template. The chosen option has an effect on the look of the panel. The default template is "Custom" which allows for a very detailed configuration with virtually any authorization server using OAuth2 authorization code grant. Other templates provide simplified views for well known and supported authorization servers. In the next steps there will first be a definition of how to use the "Custom" template followed by a view dedicated to Azure Active directory.

##### Custom template

![Request configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-1.png)

As the OAuth protocol is based on the execution of HTTP requests and redirects, a generic request configuration is provided.

The first part of the **Single sign-on** page consists of the request configuration. Here you can configure the HTTP request address, request parameters, headers and body in case of token and refresh requests. The authorize method is executed as a GET, token and refresh method by POST requests.

>**Info:** Be aware that the body field of each request, after filling placeholders with values, is sent in the request 'as is'. This means it is not encoded by {{< product-c8y-iot >}}. Many authorization servers require values inside the body to be URL-encoded (x-form-urlencoded). This can be achieved by entering already encoded values in a body field.

Specifying a logout request is optional. It performs [front-channel single logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-frontchannel-1_0.html). If configured, the user is redirected to the defined authorization server logout URL after logging out from {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.

![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-logout-custom.png)

The **Basic** section of the **Single sign-on** page consists of the following configuration settings:

![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-2.png)

|Field|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Redirect URI|Redirect parameter. Can be used in request definitions as a ${redirectUri} placeholder
|Client ID|OAuth connection client ID. Can be used in request definitions as a ${clientId} placeholder
|Button name|Name displayed on the button on the **Login** page
|Issuer|OAuth token issuer
|Provider name|Name of the provider
|Visible on Login page|Indicates whether the login option is enabled or not.
|Audience|Expected aud parameter of JWT
|Group|(Deprecated in favor of dynamic access mapping since 9.20)The initial group assigned to the user on first login
|Applications|(Deprecated in favor of dynamic access mapping since 9.20)The initial applications assigned to the user on first login

Each time a user logs in, the content of the access token is verified and is a base for user access to the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform. The following section provides the mapping between JWT claims and access to the platform.

 ![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-7.png)

 In the example above, if a user tries to login a decoded JWT claims look like:

```json
{
...
"user": "john.wick",
...
}
```

The user will be granted access to the global role "business" and the default application "cockpit".

If no access mapping matches the user access token, the user will get an "access denied" message when trying to log in. This will also happen if there is no access mapping defined causing all users to be unable to log in using SSO.

New rules can be added by clicking **Add access mapping** at the bottom. An access mapping statement can consist of multiple checks like in the image below. You can add a rule to an existing statement by clicking **and**. Click the Minus button to remove a rule.

New roles are added to the user from every matching access mapping. If one access mapping statement assigns the role "admin" and a second one assigns the role "business" and both meet the defined conditions, then the user will be granted access to the global roles "business" and "admin"."

When using "=" as operator you may use wildcards in the **Value** field. The supported wildcard is asterisk (\*) and it matches zero or more characters. For example, if you enter "cur\*" this matches "cur", "curiosity", "cursor" and anything that starts with "cur". "f\*n" matches "fn", "fission", "falcon", and anything that begins with an "f" and ends with an "n".

In case the asterisk character should be matched literally it has to be escaped by adding a backslash (\\). For example, to match exactly the string "Lorem\*ipsum" the value must be "Lorem\\*ipsum".


 ![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-8.png)

In this case the following claim will match the condition:

 ```json
 {
 ...
 "user": {
    "type": "human"
 },
 "role": [
    "ADMIN"
 ],
 ...
 }
 ```

As you can see, there is an option to verify if a value exists in a list via the "in" operator. Values can also be embedded in other objects. In this case a dot in the key implies looking into an embedded object.

By default, dynamic access mapping assigns user roles, based on the access token, on every user login. This means, that it is not possible to change the user roles inside {{< product-c8y-iot >}} as these would be overridden on next user login. To change this behaviour, select the **Use dynamic access mapping only on user creation** checkbox. 

![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/sso_dynamic_access_only_when_on_user_creation.png)

When selected, dynamic access mapping will be used only when a new user logs in to fill in the initial roles. When a user already exists in {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, the roles will not be overridden nor updated. Selecting this option also enables admins to edit roles of SSO users in the user management. For details, refer to  [Administration > Managing permissions](/users-guide/administration/#assigning-global-roles) in the *User guide*.

When a user logs in with an access token, the username can be derived from a JWT claim. The claim name can be configured in the **User ID configuration** window.

 ![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-3.png)

Next, the **User data mappings** can be configured:

![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-user-data-mappings.png)

On user login, user data like first name, last name, email and phone number can also be derived from JWT claims. Each field represents the claim name that is used to retrieve the data from JWT. The user data mapping configuration is optional and as admin manager you can only use the required fields. If the configuration is empty or the claim name cannot be found in the JWT token then the values in the user data are set as empty.

Mapping for alias is not available because it is not used in the context of single sign-on login.

Each access token is signed by a signing certificate. Currently there are three options to configure the signing certificates.

1. By specifying the Azure AD certificate discovery address.

 ![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-4.png)

2. By specifying the ADFS manifest address (for ADFS 3.0).

 ![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-9.png)

3. By providing the public key of a certificate manually to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}. A certificate definition requires an algorithm information, public key value and validity period.

 ![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-5.png)

4. By specifying the JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) address.

 ![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-9.png)


 >**Info:** {{< product-c8y-iot >}} only supports certificates with RSA key, either as a ("n", "e") parameters pair or "x5c" certificate chain. Other key types (e.g. Elliptic-curves) are not supported.
##### Placeholders
Inside some fields you can use placeholders that are resolved by {{< product-c8y-iot >}} at runtime. Available placeholders are:

|Placeholder|Description|
|:---|:---|
|clientId|Value of the **Client ID** field
|redirectUri| Value of the **Redirect URI** field
|code|Code returned by the authorization server in response to authorization request
|refreshToken| Refresh token returned by the authorization server after token request

These placeholders can be used in authorization requests, token requests, refresh requests and logout request in the fields: URL, body, headers and request parameters

To use a placeholder in a field, put it inside two curly brackets preceded with a dollar sign:
![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-placeholder-standalone.png)

Placeholders can also be used as a part of text:
![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-placeholder-text.png)

Placeholders are not validated for correctness. Any not recognized or misspelled placeholder will be left in text unprocessed.

#### Integration with Azure AD

##### Azure AD configuration

The integration was successfully verified against Azure AD. The configuration steps are available in [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-protocols-oauth-code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-protocols-oauth-code).

When configuring your Azure AD, use your full domain address as redirect URI. For the purpose of this document we assume that it is "http://documentation.{{< domain-c8y >}}/tenant/oauth". The redirect URI must be set for a web application and not for a single-page application. There are no additional steps on Azure AD required.

##### Cumulocity IoT configuration

When the "Azure AD" template is selected the configuration panel will look similar to the following:

 ![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-aad-basic.png)
 ![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-aad-basic-1.png)

|Field|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Azure AD Address| Address of your Azure AD tenant
|Tenant| Azure AD tenant name
|Application ID| Application ID
|Redirect URI| Address of your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant followed by /tenant/oauth
|Client secret| Azure AD client secret if applicable
|Button name| Button name
|Token issuer| Token issuer value in form of a HTTP address

Optionally single logout can be configured:

 ![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-logout-azure.png)

|Field|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Redirect after logout| Activates single logout by redirecting the user, after logout, to the authorization server logout endpoint
|Redirect URL| Address to redirect the user to after successful logout from the authorization server

The second part of the panel is the same as for the "Custom" template, where access mapping, user data mapping, user ID field selection and signature verification address are provided.

 ![OAuth configuration](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-aad-2.png)


##### Troubleshooting

It can be particularly helpful to inspect the content of the authorization token sent to the platform as some of its fields contain the information required for the correct configuration described above.

In Administration application, after clicking on **Accounts** > **Audit logs** you can filter by the category "Single sign-on" and look for entries "Json web token claims".

The contexts of the token will be presented in JSON format.

![Audit token content](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-sso-audit-token.png)


<a name="default-app"></a>
### Changing application settings

Click **Application** in the **Settings** menu to change applications settings.

![Default application](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-settings-application.png)

Under **Default application**, you can select a default application from the list which will apply to all users within the tenant.

>**Info:** All users must have access to this application.

Under **Access control**, administrators can enable cross-origin resource sharing or "CORS" on the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} API.

The **Allowed Domain** setting will enable your JavaScript web applications to directly communicate with REST APIs.

* Set it to "*" to allow communication from any host.
* Set it to `http://my.host.com`, `http://myother.host.com` to allow applications from `http://my.host.com` and from `http://myother.host.com` to communicate with the platform.

For further information, see [http://enable-cors.org](http://enable-cors.org).

### Managing the properties library

Click **Properties library** in the **Settings** menu, to add custom properties to inventory objects, alarms, events and tenants.

![Properties library](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-settings-properties-library.png)

With custom properties, you can extend the data model of {{< product-c8y-iot >}} built-in objects. You may create the following custom values:

- Custom inventory properties are used to extend the inventory data model. They can be used in the "Asset table" and "Asset properties" widgets.
- Custom tenant properties are available during tenant creation. The custom properties can be edited under **Subtenants** in the **Custom properties** tab of each tenant. Additionally, these properties can be viewed and exported in the **Usage statistics**.
- Custom alarm and event properties can be used as custom fields which can be added to your reports and will be available in the **Export** page in the Cockpit application.

>**Info:** Custom properties are visible to all authenticated users of the tenant, regardless of their inventory role permission.
