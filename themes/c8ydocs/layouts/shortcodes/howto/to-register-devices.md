### To register devices

To register devices, you may choose one of the following options:

* **[General device registration](#device-registration-manually)** - to manually connect one or more devices
* **[Bulk device registration](#creds-upload)** - to register larger amounts of devices in one step

If you are subscribed to the required applications you will see a third option
**Custom device registration** for registering devices of specific types, e.g. Actility LoRa or Sigfox, see the documentation for these services in the [Protocol integration guide](/protocol-integration/overview).
